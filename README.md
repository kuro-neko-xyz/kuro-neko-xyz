# About me

I am a web developer and photographer with many interests on the side. I like reading, watching movies, listening to music and playing vidya. However, my true passion is the Internet and the technological and cultural aspects of it. I believe the Internet is a gateway to divinity and through getting lost in it one can reach enlightenment.
